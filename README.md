# hello-world
Getting to know GitHub


Based out of Amsterdam, I’m a 23 year old guy who wants to become an Indie Maker.


This website is dedicated to tracking the progress towards my goal of
 achieving monthly recurring revenue by the end of 2018. I want to 
create something that generates revenue, and I want to do it using 
coding skills I develop in my spare time. I’ll be doing this while also 
working full-time. On my road to revenue, I’ll be sharing progress here transparently, to keep myself accountable, and show others what you can achieve with some effort.


I start at zero revenue. Check back here to see where the counters ends.
